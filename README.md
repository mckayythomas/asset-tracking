# Asset-Tracking API

> **Note:**
> This version of the API is developed with TypeScript, Node, MongoDB, and GraphQL.

Asset tracking is a GrapnQL project to demonstrate the skills and abilities of the developers involved. Asset tracking was created as a potential solution to help enterprises track products and material stock. 
Asset tracking was built with data consistency in mind. GraphQL resolvers are used with Typescript to ensure data is correctly inputed into a MongoDB NoSQL database.

Unit Testing was performed using Jest to ensure all routes and GraphQL is functioning properly.
